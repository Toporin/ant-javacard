# Building JavaCard applet CAP files with Ant

**Easy to use [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) task** for building JavaCard CAP files in a declarative way.

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/martinpaljak/apdu4j.svg?branch=master)

## Features
 * **[Do What I Mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM)**.
 * **No dependencies**, no extra or unrelated downloads. Just a 14KB jar.
 * Supports **all JavaCard SDK versions**: 2.1.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 3.0.3, 3.0.4 and 3.0.5
 * **Works on all platforms**: Windows, OSX, Linux.
 * Almost **everything integrates** or works with Ant.
 * Can be easily integrated into **continuous integration** workflows.
 * Generates CAP files from **sources** or **pre-compiled** class files.
 * Import *external libraries*: natural use of `.exp` files and `.jar` libraries.
 * **No restrictions** on project folder layout.
 * Loading JavaCard applets is equally pleasing with **[GlobalPlatformPro](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro)**

## Download
 * Get the [latest version](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard/releases/latest) from [release area](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard/releases).

## Use
 * Download [`ant-javacard.jar`](https://github.com/martinpaljak/ant-javacard/releases/latest/ant-javacard.jar) and put it into the library folder of your project.
 * Then add the following to your `build.xml` file:
```xml
<taskdef name="javacard" classname="pro.javacard.ant.JavaCard" classpath="lib/ant-javacard.jar"/>
```
 * Now you can create applets within your Ant targets like this:
```xml
<javacard>
  <cap jckit="/path/to/jckit_dir" aid="0102030405" output="MyApplet.cap" sources="src/myapplet">
    <applet class="myapplet.MyApplet" aid="0102030405060708"/>
  </cap>
</javacard>
```
(which results in output similar to this)
```
target:
      [cap] INFO: using JavaCard v2.2.2 SDK in ../jc222_kit
      [cap] Setting package name to testapplets
      [cap] Building CAP with 1 applet from package testapplets
      [cap] testapplets.Empty 0102030405060708
  [compile] Compiling 1 source file to /var/folders/l7/h99c5w6j0y1b8_qbsth_9v4r0000gn/T/antjc4506897175807383834
      [cap] CAP saved to /Users/martin/projects/ant-javacard/Empty222.cap
```
## Syntax
Sample:

```xml
<javacard jckit="/path/to/jckit_dir1">
  <cap jckit="/path/to/jckit_dir2" aid="0102030405" package="package.name" version="0.1" output="MyApplet.cap" sources="src/myapplet" classes="path/to/classes" export="mylib">
    <applet class="myapplet.MyApplet" aid="0102030405060708"/>
    <import exps="path/to/exps" jar="/path/to/lib.jar"/>
  </cap>
</javacard>
```
Details:
 * `javacard` tag - generic task
   * `jckit` attribute - path to the JavaCard SDK that is used if individual `cap` does not specify one. Optional if `cap` defines one, required otherwise.
 * `cap` tag - construct a CAP file
   * `jckit` attribute - path to the JavaCard SDK to be used for this CAP. Optional if `javacard` defines one, required otherwise. 
   * `sources` attribute - path to Java source code, to be compiled against the current JavaCard SDK. Either `sources` or `classes` is required.
   * `classes` attribute - path to pre-compiled class files to be assembled into a CAP file. If both `classes` and `sources` are specified, compiled class files will be put to `classes` folder, which is created if missing.
   * `package` attribute - name of the package of the CAP file. Optional - set to the parent package of the applet class if left unspecified.
   * `versi` attribute - version of the package. Optional - defaults to 0.0 if left unspecified.
   * `aid``` attribute - AID (hex) of the package. Recommended - or set to the 5 first bytes of the applet AID if left unspecified.
   * `output` attribute - path where to save the generated CAP file. Required.
   * `export` attribtue - path (folder) where to place the JAR and generated EXP file. Optional.
   * `jca` attribute - path where to save the generated JavaCard Assembly (JCA) file. Optional.
 * `applet` tag - for creating an applet inside the CAP
   * `class` attribute - class of the Applet where install() method is defined. Required.
   * `aid` attribute - AID (hex) of the applet. Recommended - or set to package `aid`+`i` where `i` is index of the applet definition in the build.xml instruction
 * `import` tag - for linking against external components/libraries, like `GPSystem` or `OPSystem`
   * `exps` attribute - path to the folder keeping `.exp` files. Required
   * `jar` attribute - path to the JAR file for compilation. Optional - only required if using `sources` mode and not necessary with `classes` mode if java code is already compiled

Notes:
 * `jc.home` property has the highest precedence, followed by `jckit` path of `cap`, followed by path in `javacard`, followed by `JC_HOME` environment variable. SDK must be valid to be considered for use.
